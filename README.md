# Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by _Our World in Data_


### üóÇÔ∏è Download our complete COVID-19 dataset : [CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) | [XLSX](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.xlsx) | [JSON](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json)

Our complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by [_Our World in Data_](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). We will update it daily throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (more information on our updating process and schedule [here](https://docs.owid.io/projects/covid/en/latest/data-pipeline.html#overview)). It includes the following data:

A [specific section of this repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) is also dedicated to **vaccinations**, with a lighter dataset containing only vaccination data.


## The data you find here and our data sources

- **Confirmed cases and deaths:** our data comes from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (JHU). We discuss how and when JHU collects and publishes this data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily.
  - Note: confirmed cases and deaths are collected by Johns Hopkins University by date of report, rathen than date of test/death. Therefore the number they report on a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date, because of the long reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. This also means that time series can show sudden changes (negative or positive) when a country corrects historical data, because it had previously under- or overestimated the number of cases/deaths.
- **Hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions:** our data is collected from official sources and collated by Our World in Data. The complete list of country-by-country sources is available [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/hospitalizations/locations.csv).
- **Testing for COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports; you can find further details in our post on COVID-19 testing, including our [checklist of questions to understand testing data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data), information on [geographical and temporal coverage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for), and [detailed country-by-country source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country). The testing dataset is updated around twice a week.
- **Vaccinations against COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports.
- **Other variables:** this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Global Burden of Disease, Blavatnik School of Government, etc.). More information is available in [our codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv).


## The variables explanation will be used accroding to Data_ COVID-19 dataset

**Our complete COVID-19 dataset is available in [CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv), [XLSX](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.xlsx), and [JSON](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json) formats, and includes all of our historical data on the pandemic up to the date of publication.**


The variables represent all of our main data related to confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest.

| `new_cases`                      | New confirmed cases of COVID-19. Counts can include probable cases, where reported. In rare 

### Confirmed deaths
| Variable                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `new_deaths`                      | New deaths attributed to COVID-19. Counts can include probable deaths, where reported. In rare cases where our source reports a negative daily change due to a data correction, we set this metric to NA. |
| `new_deaths_per_million`          | New deaths attributed to COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people. Counts can include probable deaths, where reported.                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Notes:
* Due to varying protocols and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death, the number of confirmed deaths may not accurately represent the true number of deaths caused by COVID-19.

- [`excess_mortality`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/excess_mortality): data on excess mortality during the pandemic, sourced from [the Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) and [the UK Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020);
- [`vaccinations`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations): data from various official sources, related to COVID-19 vaccinations in each country;
- [`archived`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/archived): data from other providers that we have stopped using and updating;
- [`internal`](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/internal): data extracts intended for internal use at _Our World in Data_. They may change or be deleted without notice so we discourage using them.
